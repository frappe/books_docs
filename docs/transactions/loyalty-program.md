## Loyalty Program Functionality

### Earning Points

1. Assign this Loyalty Program to a Customer.
2. Create a new Sales Invoice for the Customer to whom you have assigned
   Loyalty Program.
3. For this example, an invoice is created with a grand total of 3,000 INR.
   According to the Loyalty Program, if a customer spends a minimum of
   2,000 INR, they are eligible to earn loyalty points. For every 300 INR
   spent, the customer will receive 1 loyalty point. Therefore, with a total
   spend of 3,000 INR, the customer earns 10 loyalty points.
4. Upon submission of the invoice, a Loyalty Point Entry will be created for
   this invoice. This acts as a log to give an overview of which Customer
   earned how many points against which Sales Invoice.

### Redeeming Points

1. When creating an invoice for a Customer who has loyalty points, go to the
   Loyalty Point Redemption section and enable the checkbox
   **Redeem Loyalty Points**.
2. The fields for **Loyalty Points** will become visible under this section.
   You can fill in the points to redeem.
3. The total amount of the invoice will be adjusted based on the redeemed
   points, and you will only need to pay the remaining balance after the points
   have been applied.
