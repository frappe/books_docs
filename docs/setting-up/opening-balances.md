# Setup Opening Balances

If you are moving from an existing accounting system over to Frappe Books, you
will need to enter the account balances from your previous system.

To set the Opening Balances you can follow the steps below.

## Get The Starting Balances

Get the starting balances from your previous accounting system in the form of
Trial Balances report.

## Add Additional Accounts

Add any accounts from your previous system that do not exist in Frappe Books by
navigating to the Chart of Accounts.

You can follow the steps shown
[here](/setting-up/initial-entries#add-additional-bank-accounts). Make sure you create
the Accounts under the correct Account groups.

## Create a Journal Entry

`Common > Journal Entry`

Then click on the blue `+` button to open the **Journal Entry** form.

1. Set the Entry Type as Opening Entry.
2. Add a row for each line from your Trial Balances report, select the
   appropriate Account and the Debit or Credit amount.
3. Click on Save. Review it once before clicking on Submit.

You can set a Reference Number and Reference Date to mark the entry.

This will create a Journal Transaction in the system with all your previous
statements.
