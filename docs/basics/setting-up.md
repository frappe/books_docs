# Getting Started with Frappe Books

Let’s start applying what we have learned so far by setting up your company in Frappe Books.

If you have not downloaded Frappe Books, this is a good time to do that. Simply
visit [frappebooks.com](https://frappebooks.com) and click on Download.

## Company Setup

When you open Frappe Books, you’ll be presented two options: New File and
Existing File. If this is the first time you are opening Frappe Books, click on
New File.

Now select an appropriate location where you want to store the file and give it
a name. Usually, you would want to give the name of your company.

Now, enter your Business Name, Business Email and Country Information. This will
help set up the correct Chart of Accounts based on your country.

Congratulations! You now have a company set up on Frappe Books. You can now
start recording your invoices and transactions.

Let’s go over some simple setup steps to get you ready.

### 1. Enter bank accounts

Head over to Chart of Accounts page, by clicking on Setup > Chart of Accounts
from the sidebar. Click Assets > Current Assets > Bank Accounts.

### 2. Add Taxes

If your company charges or will recover Sales Taxes, add any taxes that you will
use. To access Taxes, go to Setup > Taxes.

1. To add a Tax, enter a name which will make it easier to identify. You can
   also mention the rate in the name. For e.g. Service Tax - 5%.

1. Select the Tax Account and enter the Rate. You can add multiple rows with
   different Tax Accounts. This will make it easier to apply a set of Taxes
   which are frequently applied together on an Item. You can even create
   different taxes for different Items or a class of Items.

One of the most important things you will add in Books are your products or
services that you provide to your customers. To access Items, go to Sales >
Items.

1. Click on the blue plus button.
1. Enter the Name and Rate.
1. Select if your Item is a Product or Service. Setting the default Tax for your
   Item will fetch it automatically when you create an Invoice.

also import your customers in bulk if you have them in an Excel sheet.

### 5. Setup Opening Balances

If you are moving from an existing accounting system over to Frappe Books, you
will need to enter the account balances from your previous system.

Here are the steps to do that:

1. Get the starting balances from your previous accounting system in the form of
   Trial Balances report.
2. Add any accounts from your previous system that do not exist in Frappe Books
   by goint to Setup > Chart of Accounts.
3. Now go to Sales > Journal Entry and click on the blue plus button, a journal
   entry form will open.
4. Now, add a row for each line from your Trial Balances report, select the
   appropriate Account and the Debit or Credit amount.
5. After you are done, click on Save. Review it once before clicking on Submit.

This will create a Journal Transaction in the system with all your previous
statements. This brings your books to the same position that was present in your
previous accounting system.
