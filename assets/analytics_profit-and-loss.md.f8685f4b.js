At the end of the period, (a fiscal year) the total profit (or loss) goes into Owner\u2019s Equity because the profit in the business belongs to the owners. The owner\u2019s account is a liability to the company since the company has to pay out the profits/losses.</p><p>To check your P&amp;L statement, navigate to it using the sidebar: <code>Reports &gt; Profit And Loss</code></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="Profit and Loss"></p><p>By default the Profit and Loss report will show P&amp;L values for the last 3 months.</p><p>As you can clearly see, we have the total Income in the first part which also shows the income coming from each Income account split Monthly so you have a better understanding of your income.
